### Pre-Commit Hooks

We use [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com) to run [some hooks](./.pre-commit-config.yaml) on every commit.  These
hooks do linting to ensure things are in a good spot before a commit is made.  Please install `pre-commit` and then
install the hooks.

```shell
pre-commit install
```


### Testing

#### Unit Tests
```shell
make unitTests
```

#### End-to-end Tests

#### Load Testing


### Deploying

#### Environments

##### Internal

##### Dev

The Dev environment is similar to the Internal environment but deploys to a CDC Azure Entra domain and subscription.  It
is also meant to be the Wild West.  Dev deploys similarly to the Internal environment, but you interact with the
`dev` branch.

##### Staging

The Staging environment is production-like and meant to be stable.  It deploys to a CDC Azure Entra domain and
subscription.  Deployments occur when a commit is made to the `main` branch.  `main` is a protected branch and requires
PR reviews before merge.

##### Prod

The Production environment is the real deal.  It deploys to a CDC Azure Entra domain and subscription.  Deployments
occur when a release is published.
