# 4. Docker Containerization

Date: 2024-06-03

## Decision

We will use [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/) for containerization of our application.

## Status

Accepted.

## Context

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment. Some benefits of using Docker:
- Develop your application and its supporting components using containers.
- The container becomes the unit for distributing and testing your application.
- When youâ€™re ready, deploy your application into your production environment, as a container or an orchestrated service.
- Allows for responsive deployment and scaling.

We also already use Docker in [TI](https://github.com/CDCgov/trusted-intermediary)
