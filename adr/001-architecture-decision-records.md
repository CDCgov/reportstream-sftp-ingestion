# 1. Architecture Decision Records

Date: 2024-05-14

## Decision

We will use Architectural Decisions Records (ADRs).  We will use the same format as this ADR.

## Status

Accepted.

## Context

ADRs are originally described by
[Michael Nygard in an article](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)
and more robustly detailed and demonstrated [on GitHub](https://adr.github.io).

We want to record our architectural decisions so that...

- New team members who join can see why we made the decisions we made.
- The team can revise or revisit decisions with more confidence and context.
