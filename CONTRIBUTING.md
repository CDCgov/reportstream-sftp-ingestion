## Commit Signing

[Signing your commits](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits)
is required on this repository and ensures that you truly authored them.  Technically, there is nothing built into `git` that stops me from changing my
git author information to be a forgery of yours and making commits that look like they came from you.  Commit signing
relies on PKI which is incredibly hard to break.

There are many permutations on the steps below if you want a more complex set-up.  For example, sub keys, different
capabilities, and different key types.  This guide does not go into those intricacies.

### Prerequisites

You need to install GPG.  If you are on a Mac, you can do this easily with [Brew](https://brew.sh).

```shell
brew install gnupg
```

### Create a Signing Key

Follow the steps outlined on
[GitHub's documentation for generating a GPG key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/generating-a-new-gpg-key),
but consider the following.

- When it asks for what kind of key you want, pick `RSA (sign only)` (which is commonly option 4).
- When it asks for what key size you want, enter in `4096`.
- Remember the password you set!

### Add the Key to GitHub

Follow the steps outlined on
[GitHub's documentation for adding your GPG key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/adding-a-gpg-key-to-your-github-account).

### Set-up Git to Sign Commits

Follow just the GPG key steps outlined on
[GitHub's documentation for configuring git with your signing key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/telling-git-about-your-signing-key),
but consider the following.

- When running the `git config` commands, you may not want to use `--global` unless you want the settings to apply to
  all your cloned git repositories, even ones that aren't from GitHub.
- You will only need to install and configure a GUI PIN entry program (for example, `pinentry-mac`) if you don't do
  your commits in a terminal.  For example, a non-terminal, GUI interface in your IDE or the GitHub application.

### (Optional) Move the Key to a YubiKey

Following these steps will result in your YubiKey holding your signing key.  This will require your YubiKey to be
plugged-in whenever you make a commit.  You will no longer need to remember the password for the key but instead need
to enter the YubiKey PIN from time to time.

Follow the steps outlined on [drduh's YubiKey GPG guide](https://github.com/drduh/YubiKey-Guide#configure-smartcard),
but consider the following.

- There's no need to set the information on the YubiKey like the name, lang, or login.
- If you've followed this process, there is just the ultimate key to move over, not any sub keys.  You'll only move
  over the ultimate key to the signature key (not encryption, not authentication) part of the YubiKey.
